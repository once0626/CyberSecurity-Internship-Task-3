# Task 3 – Networking Basics for Cyber Security

## 📌 Objective
The objective of this task is to understand basic networking concepts and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark. This task helps in learning how data flows in a network and how cyber security professionals inspect packets for analysis.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Wireshark  
- Sample PCAP file / Live network traffic

---

## 📡 Task Performed
- Opened and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark.
- Applied display filters to inspect different protocols such as TCP, DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS.
- Observed the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
- Captured and analyzed DNS queries to understand domain name resolution.
- Identified plain-text traffic in HTTP.
- Identified encrypted traffic in HTTPS (TLS).
- Saved the packet capture file for analysis.

---

## 🔍 Key Observations
- TCP establishes a reliable connection using a three-way handshake.
- DNS converts domain names into IP addresses.
- HTTP traffic is readable and not secure.
- HTTPS traffic is encrypted and more secure.
- Packet sniffing helps in understanding network behavior and detecting anomalies.

## 📂 Files Included
- `task3_network_capture.pcapng` – Packet capture file
- `analysis_report.txt` – Analysis and observations
- `README.md` – Task documentation

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This task helped me understand how network traffic works and how Wireshark is used in cyber security to analyze packets. It improved my knowledge of networking fundamentals and packet analysis.
